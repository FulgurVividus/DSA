## 📊 Frequency Counter Pattern

📌 **Concept:**

- Uses **objects** or **sets** to collect **values/frequencies** of values.
- Helps **avoid nested loops** and reduce **O(N²)** operations to **O(N)**.

✅ **Great for:**

- Comparing multiple pieces of data efficiently 🏎️
- Checking for anagrams 🔠
- Finding unique values 🎲

---

## 🎯 Multiple Pointers Pattern

📌 **Concept:**

- Creates **pointers** (or values) that correspond to an index or position.
- Moves pointers **towards the beginning, end, or middle** based on conditions.
- **Minimizes space complexity** while solving problems efficiently. 🏗️

✅ **Great for:**

- Pair sum problems 🔢 ➕
- Detecting palindromes 🔄
- Removing duplicates 🎭

## 🪟 Sliding Window Pattern

📌 **Concept:**

- Creates a **window** (a subset of data) that moves **across** an input.
- The window **expands** or **shrinks** based on conditions. 🪟
- Useful for keeping track of **subsets of data** in arrays/strings.

✅ **Great for:**

- Finding maximum/minimum values in a subarray 📊
- Longest substring problems 🔠
- Optimizing performance by reducing redundant computations ⚡

---

## ⚔️ Divide and Conquer Pattern

📌 **Concept:**

- **Divides** a data set into **smaller chunks**.
- Solves each smaller problem **recursively** and combines the results. 🔄
- **Significantly decreases time complexity**. ⏳

✅ **Great for:**

- Searching in sorted arrays (Binary Search) 📚🔍
- Efficient sorting algorithms (Merge Sort, Quick Sort) 🔢
- Solving complex mathematical problems 🎯
