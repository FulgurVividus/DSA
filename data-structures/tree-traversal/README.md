# 🌳 TREE TRAVERSAL

## 🔍 TRAVERSING A TREE

There are two primary ways to traverse a tree:

### 1️⃣ **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**

- Explore all nodes at the present depth before moving to the next level.

### 2️⃣ **Depth-First Search (DFS)**

- Explore as far as possible along a branch before backtracking.
- Variations of DFS:
  - 📌 **Pre-Order** (Root ➝ Left ➝ Right)
  - 📌 **In-Order** (Left ➝ Root ➝ Right)
  - 📌 **Post-Order** (Left ➝ Right ➝ Root)

## 🛠 RECAP

- ✅ **Trees** are non-linear data structures consisting of a root and child nodes.
- ✅ **Binary Trees** have at most two children per parent.
- ✅ **Binary Search Trees (BSTs)** follow a specific order:

- Left child < Parent
- Right child > Parent
  ✅ **Tree Traversal Methods** include BFS and DFS, with different DFS variations for different use cases.
