# 📚 Stacks & Queues

## 📌 What is a Stack?

- A **LIFO (Last In, First Out)** data structure! 🏗️
- The last element added is the first to be removed.

### 🎯 How is it Used?

- Imagine a **stack of plates** 🍽️, a **stack of books** 📚, or even a **stack of markers** 🖊️.
- The last item you put on the top is the first one you take off.

### 🏆 Where are Stacks Used?

- **Managing function calls** (Call Stack) 🖥️
- **Undo/Redo operations** ↩️↪️
- **Navigating web history** 🌐

### ⚙️ Ways to Implement a Stack:

1. **Using an Array** 📋
2. **Using a Linked List** 🔗

### ⏳ Big O Complexity of Stacks:

| Operation | Time Complexity |
| --------- | --------------- |
| Insertion | O(1) 🚀         |
| Removal   | O(1) ⚡         |
| Searching | O(N) 🐢         |
| Access    | O(N) 🐌         |

## 📌 What is a Queue?

- A **FIFO (First In, First Out)** data structure! 🚦
- The first element added is the first to be removed.

### 🎯 Real-World Examples

- **Waiting in line** at a store 🏪
- **Processing background tasks** ⏳
- **Uploading resources** ☁️
- **Print queue in a printer** 🖨️

### ⏳ Big O Complexity of Queues:

| Operation | Time Complexity |
| --------- | --------------- |
| Insertion | O(1) 🚀         |
| Removal   | O(1) ⚡         |
| Searching | O(N) 🐢         |
| Access    | O(N) 🐌         |

## 🔥 Recap

- ✅ **Stacks** are **LIFO**, meaning the last value added is the first one out.
- ✅ **Used for function calls, undo/redo operations, routing, and more!**
- ✅ **Insertion and removal are O(1).**
- ✅ **Queues** are **FIFO**, meaning the first value in is the first one out.
- ✅ **Used for processing tasks, background operations, and scheduling.**
- ✅ **Insertion and removal are O(1).**
