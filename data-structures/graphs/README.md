## 🔍 What Are Graphs?

A **graph** is a data structure that consists of a set of **vertices (nodes)** connected by **edges (links)**. Graphs can be **directed** or **undirected**, and **weighted** or **unweighted**.

### 🛠 Components of a Graph:

- **Vertex (Node)** - A fundamental unit of the graph.
- **Edge** - A connection between two vertices.
- **Weighted/Unweighted** - Indicates if edges have values.
- **Directed/Undirected** - Specifies if edges have a direction.

## 🚀 Uses of Graphs

Graphs are **everywhere!** Some real-world applications include:

- 🌍 **Social Networks** (Friendships, followers, recommendations)
- 🗺️ **Location/Mapping** (Google Maps, GPS routing)
- 🛤️ **Routing Algorithms** (Internet data transfer, shortest path algorithms)
- 🎨 **Visual Hierarchy** (Rendering, dependency graphs)
- 🖥️ **File System Optimizations** (Directory structures, file linking)

## 📌 Types of Graphs

### 📌 **Based on Edge Direction:**

- **Undirected Graph** - Edges have no direction.
- **Directed Graph (Digraph)** - Edges have a specific direction.

### 📌 **Based on Weights:**

- **Weighted Graph** - Edges have assigned weights (e.g., road distances).
- **Unweighted Graph** - Edges have no weights.

## 📊 Storing Graphs

Graphs can be represented using:

### 1️⃣ **Adjacency List** 📝

- Uses an array of lists.
- Efficient for sparse graphs.
- Faster iteration over edges.

### 2️⃣ **Adjacency Matrix** 📊

- Uses a 2D matrix.
- Efficient for dense graphs.
- Faster lookup of specific edges.

## 🏆 Recap

- ✔ Graphs consist of **nodes** and **edges**.
- ✔ They can be **directed or undirected**, **weighted or unweighted**.
- ✔ Graphs are widely used in **networking, AI, and real-world applications**.
- ✔ Stored using **Adjacency Lists** (space-efficient) or **Adjacency Matrices** (fast lookup).
