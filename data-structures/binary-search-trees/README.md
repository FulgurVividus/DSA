# 🌳 TREES

## What is a Tree? 🌱

A **tree** is a hierarchical data structure that consists of **nodes** in a **parent-child** relationship.

### Lists vs Trees

- **Lists** → Linear (like an array or linked list)
- **Trees** → Non-linear (branched structure)

## 🌲 Tree Terminology

- **Root** → The top node in a tree.
- **Child** → A node directly connected to another node when moving away from the root.
- **Parent** → The converse notion of a child.
- **Siblings** → A group of nodes with the same parent.
- **Leaf** 🍃 → A node with no children.
- **Edge** → The connection between one node and another.

## 🌍 Real-World Applications of Trees

- ✅ HTML DOM (Document Object Model) 📄
- ✅ Network Routing 🛜
- ✅ Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) 🛠️
- ✅ Artificial Intelligence (Decision Trees) 🧠

## 🌳 Kinds of Trees

- **General Trees** → Nodes can have any number of children.
- **Binary Trees** → Each node has at most **two** children.
- **Binary Search Trees (BSTs)** → A sorted binary tree.

## 🔢 How Binary Search Trees (BST) Work?

- Every **parent node** has at most **two** children.
- Every **node to the left** of a parent is **less than** the parent.
- Every **node to the right** of a parent is **greater than** the parent.

## ⏳ Big O of BST Operations

| Operation | Time Complexity |
| --------- | --------------- |
| Insertion | O(log n) 🔽     |
| Searching | O(log n) 🔍     |
