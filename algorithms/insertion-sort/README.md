# ðŸš€ Insertion Sort

**Insertion Sort** builds up the sorted portion of the array by gradually expanding a left half that is always sorted.

**Insertion sort** is a simple sorting algorithm that works by iteratively inserting each element of an unsorted list into its correct position in a sorted portion of the list. It is like sorting playing cards in your hands. You split the cards into two groups: the sorted cards and the unsorted cards. Then, you pick a card from the unsorted group and put it in the right place in the sorted group.

- We start with second element of the array as first element in the array is assumed to be sorted.
- Compare second element with the first element and check if the second element is smaller then swap them.
- Move to the third element and compare it with the first two elements and put at its correct position
- Repeat until the entire array is sorted.

| Algorithm          | Best Case ðŸŸ¢ | Average Case ðŸ”µ | Worst Case ðŸ”´ | Space Complexity ðŸ’¾ |
| ------------------ | ------------ | --------------- | ------------- | ------------------- |
| **Bubble Sort**    | O(n)         | O(nÂ²)           | O(nÂ²)         | O(1)                |
| **Insertion Sort** | O(n)         | O(nÂ²)           | O(nÂ²)         | O(1)                |
| **Selection Sort** | O(nÂ²)        | O(nÂ²)           | O(nÂ²)         | O(1)                |

## ðŸ”¥ Recap

- âœ… Sorting is a **fundamental** concept in computer science!
- âœ… Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort are all **basic sorting algorithms**.
- âœ… These sorting algorithms have **quadratic** average time complexity (O(nÂ²)), making them inefficient for large datasets.

ðŸš€ We can do **better** with more advanced algorithms like **Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Radix Sort!**
