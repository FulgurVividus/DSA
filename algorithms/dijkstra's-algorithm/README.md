# 🚀 Dijkstra's Algorithm

## 🧐 What is it?

- One of the most famous and widely used algorithms!
- Finds the **shortest path** between two vertices in a graph.
- Answers the question: **"What's the fastest way to get from point A to point B?"**

## 👨‍💻 Who was Dijkstra?

- **Edsger Dijkstra** was a Dutch programmer, physicist, and essayist.
- A pioneer in computer science, helping shape it into an academic discipline.
- Many of his algorithms and discoveries are **still widely used today**! 🎯

## 🎯 Why is it useful?

Dijkstra's Algorithm is widely used in real-world applications, such as:

- 🗺️ **GPS Navigation** – Finding the fastest route.
- 🌐 **Network Routing** – Determines the shortest open path for data.
- 🧬 **Biology** – Models the spread of viruses among humans.
- ✈️ **Airline Ticketing** – Finds the cheapest route to your destination.
- 🔍 And many **more applications** in various fields!

## 🔄 Recap

✅ Graphs are collections of **vertices (nodes)** connected by **edges**.
✅ Graphs can be represented using **adjacency lists** or **adjacency matrices**.
✅ Graphs may include **weights**, **directions**, and **cycles**.
✅ Just like trees, graphs can be **traversed using BFS and DFS**.
✅ Shortest path algorithms like **Dijkstra's Algorithm** can be modified with **heuristics** for optimization.
